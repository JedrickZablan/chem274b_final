#Grading

PART 1

LO1: 
LO2: 

Did not write test for rules
Implementing a cell data structure could've been more readable. a struct with one int state for example
Rule could've also been implemented as a data structure


PART 2

LO1: 
LO2: 

Application building. 
Makefiles and correct done efficiently
Visualization working
